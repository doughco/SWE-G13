Camera_
Hardware Selection 
Objective : To capture reliable images inside a refrigerator container.

Caméra 
The selected camera should feature a native CSI connector for direct integration with the Raspberry Pi, a fixed lens with adjustable focus optimized for the average distance inside the container, and low noise performance in low-light conditions to ensure high-quality, reliable images within the refrigerator environment.
Recommended parts :
-	Official IMX219 Camera Module (8 MP) :
An economical, fully supported by the Raspberry Pi, ideal for lightweight embedded applications.
-	IMX477 High Quality (HQ) Camera Module :
A compact yet more powerful option, offering higher image quality and better performance in low-light conditions.

Integrated lighting
A small diffused white LED, powered through a GPIO pin with a resistor and activated by a script before capture, ensures clear images even in the darkness of the refrigerator, while avoiding glare or harsh shadows through the use of a plastic diffuser.

Recommended parts :
-	Kingbright WP710A10WDT or any 5 mm diffused white LED ( 150 Ω resistor )
-	Waveshare Camera LED Ring Light for Raspberry Pi

Connectique
15-pin CSI ribbon cable, with a maximum length of 10–15 cm to avoid signal interference.
Software Architecture 
Objective : Develop a robust, simple, and lightweight embedded AI solution.

-	Camera capture and driver : libcamera + Picamera2. Modern stack officially maintained by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

-	Image processing : OpenCV . Used for image cropping, resizing, and preprocessing before inference.

Recommended Camera Parameters

Parameter	Recommended Value	Justification
Resolution	640×480 or 800×600	Sufficient for food classification while reducing computation time.
Format	JPEG 	Good balance between image quality and file size.
Capture frequency	1 photo every 10–30 minutes or triggered when the container is opened	Optimizes energy and resource usage.
Exposure	Automatic at startup, then fixed	Ensures consistent image brightness across captures.
White balance	Fixed based on LED lighting	Maintains stable color tones.
Focus	Manually adjusted fixed lens	Guarantees sharp images at a defined distance inside the container.
