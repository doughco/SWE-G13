**Smart Fridge Connected Smart Container**


## Project Proposal

This electronic “Smart Container” aims to provide a convenient way to allow users to track and maintain the freshness of the container’s contents within a smart fridge. 

With the use of a combination of a LAN connection and a built in timer, the Smart Container intends to connect to the Smart Fridge and provide real time information of the duration the contents within have been present for. 

By constantly communicating with the Smart Fridge through a seamless connection, the Smart Container will relay time and location information of the container, informing the user via Built-in lights and a Notification alert sent to the user’s preferred device of the duration the container has been in the fridge for and whether the container has been outside the fridge for a set duration of time. 

By informing the user of this information, we aim to minimize food spoilage and potential food waste from accumulating within the fridge of the user.
