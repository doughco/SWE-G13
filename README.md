**Smart Fridge Connected Smart Container**


## Project Proposal
>
>This electronic “Smart Container” aims to provide a convenient way to allow users to track and maintain the freshness of the container’s contents within a smart fridge. 
>
>With the use of a combination of a LAN connection and a built in timer, the Smart Container intends to connect to the Smart Fridge and provide real time information of the duration the contents within have been present for. 
>
>By constantly communicating with the Smart Fridge through a seamless connection, the Smart Container will relay time and location information of the container, informing the user via Built-in lights and a Notification alert sent to the >user’s preferred device of the duration the container has been in the fridge for and whether the container has been outside the fridge for a set duration of time. 
>
>By informing the user of this information, we aim to minimize food spoilage and potential food waste from accumulating within the fridge of the user.

## About this project
The Smart Container is a container that can track and relay data to your mobile devices via a dedicated app. The container provides tracking data such as how long the shelf-life of the food inside has left, whether it is inside the fridge or not, and the status of each container.
